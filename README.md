Tidy Data - UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

In this repo you will find:

Run_analysis.R -> A script in R which will download a UCI dataset called "UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" from this link "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", you can also get more information about it on "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones".
The script will process the data in order to:
a. Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
b.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
c.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
d.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
e.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Finally, it will create two tidy data sets and save in your R working environment.
tidyData.txt -> Data set summarized inder to creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
CodeBook.md -> A code book that describes the variables and the data.
